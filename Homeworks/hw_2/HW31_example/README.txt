If you don't have a dataset of your own to reproduce, you can reproduce the plot "EfficiencyPurityAnnotated.png" (adapted from Morgan et al. 2012, The Astrophysical Journal, 746, 170).

The data for the two plots are in Efficiency.txt and Purity.txt. The main curves can be found by plotting "frac_followed" against "frac_observed".  The grey uncertainty region is bounded by the two curves "frac_observed + frac_observed_uncertainty" and "frac_observed - frac_observed_uncertainty"

The horizontal line in the purity plot is at y=(18.0/135.0)

Don't worry about matching the locations of the annotations exactly, but make it look nice (don't have text overlapping any data).
