    "\n",
    "`Numpy` masked arrays provide a way to keep track of elements that are considered \"missing\" or \"bad\". This is extremely useful when performing statistics on such arrays---masked elements should not be included in determining, for example the mean.  Masked arrays are really helpful when combining images too that have known regions of bad or bogus data.\n",

Using `scipy.ndimage.interpolation.shift` perform a shift on the other four images such that they are \"registered\" (aligned) with the first image. That is, make sure that the black dots are all in the same x,y location in the transformed images. Keep those images in `numpy` arrays (for the next part) but also save those images as `.png` files, appropriately named (`im1-b-shift.png`, `im1-c-shift.png`, etc.). Note: you'll need to think a bit about how you treat the edges in the `shift` operation."
