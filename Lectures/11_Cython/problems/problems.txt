.. Some exercises borrowed from Pauli Virtanen's 2011 lecture


Cythonizing
-----------

Implement a function in Cython that computes ``x**3 - 4x + 2`` on each element
of a large floating point array.  Is this function faster than NumPy
by default?  If so, can you explain why?

Benchmarking the NumPy code in IPython::

  import numpy as np
  x = np.linspace(0, 1, 10000)
  %timeit x**3 - 4*x + 2

(do the same for your Cython code)


Wrapping C
----------

In the ``wrapping`` directory is a simple C library computing the ``sin``
elementwise for a Numpy array. The header ``stuff.h`` defines a function with
the signature::

    void compute(int n, double *input, double *output)

which takes two C arrays of doubles containing ``n`` doubles.

Write a Cython wrapper::

    def do_compute(double[::1] input_array):
        ...
        return output_array

for this function.  Note: whenever ``::1`` is specified for an axis, it means
that that dimension should be contiguous in memory.

You can find the pointer to an array with, e.g., ``&input_array[0, 0]``.  E.g.,
this will yield the equivalent of ``double *``, ready for use in C.

The behaviour of the function can be verified with ``run.py``.


Conway's Game of Life
---------------------

.. topics: Numpy interface, general Numpy usage

The Game of Life is a well-known cellular automaton that exhibits interesting
behavior. It is defined on a grid of cells, where each cell has 8 neighbors::

   .........
   .........
   ...ooo...
   ...oxo...
   ...ooo...
   .........
   .........

The update rule to get a new state from the old one is:

- Cells with with fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors die.
- Cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.

Write a Cython function ``life_update(old_state, new_state)`` that
takes an `N x N` Numpy array `old_state` of type ``int`` containing
the old state, and writes the new state to a similar array
`new_state`. Just use four nested for-loops, but remember to add type
declarations.

Image files containing well-known starting shapes are supplied (use
``matplotlib.pyplot.imread`` to read them into Numpy arrays). Assign them at
the center of a big grid, and see what happens!

- ``glider.png``: the glider

- ``glider_gun.png``: the Gosper glider gun

- ``breeder.png``: one sort of a breeder

- ... and others!

These examples come from the very interesting Game of Life simulator
`Golly <http://golly.sf.net/>`__.

.. topic:: Animation in Matplotlib

   The Matplotlib gallery contains an example on how to `animate an image
   <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/animation/dynamic_image.html>`__.


L-Systems
---------
Implement an `L-system <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system>`__ in Cython.
Try, for example, to build a Sierpinski Triangle or the Dragon Curve.  If you
want, you can first implement it in pure Python, and then add the type
information later.


Hints
`````

 - Use your Cython program to generate coordinates, then simply "connect the
   dots" using ``matplotlib`` (``import matplotlib.pyplot as plt;
   plt.plot(...)``).

 - Cython can accelerate operations on non-numerical types too.  For example,
   if you store your coordinates in a list, you can use::

     cdef list L = []

   For dictionaries, the type is ``dict``.
